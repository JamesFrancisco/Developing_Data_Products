This app has been developed for the Developing Data Products Course, from Coursera. This app helps a user to choose a car for daily commuting, using the mtcars dataset from [R]. The mtcars data set is somewhat stale. To make this app useful for drivers now, a data frame with data for current cars would need to be built 

User Instructions:
Select daily commuting distance, average cost of gasoline, and a daily commuting budget.

These parameters will create a list of cars that will fit the user's commuting budget.

The user can also choose some characteristcs of the cars: 
Cylinders, Displacement, Horse Power and Transmission. 
The table will show only the cars with the filters selected. 
The table can be sorted according any variable by clicking the arrows at the top of the table.
